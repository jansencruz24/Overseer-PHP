    <b> Farming & Conservation: A Perfect Mix</b>
    <p> Land preservation simply means restricting the uses of a property over a long time. 
        The uses are limited when private property is acquired in a fee simple transaction by a
        government agency, such as land for a county park, or by a qualified nonprofit organization,
        such as land for a nature preserve.</p>
